# Mastering git: class 2 lab

## Class 2 topics

* Branches
* Tags
* Merging
* Stash


## Lab task

* Clone our repository that we prepared for this
* Delete branch “wip-show-sample-commands”
* Does the “add-lab-description” top commit look okay?
  * Fix the problem once you spot it
* Create a new branch that starts from add-lab-description, name it “fix”
* Oh, that’s not a good branch name, sorry. Rename the branch from “fix” to “fix-add-lab-description”
* Merge fix-add-lab-description into main
* BONUS: push your local main into your fork
* **EPIC BONUS**: Create a pull request from fix-add-lab-description to the upstream repository
